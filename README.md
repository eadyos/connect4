# Connect 4

This is a Ruby, Rails, Angular JS implementation of the classic Connect 4 game.

It is currently deployed and running on heroku here: https://mighty-harbor-94790.herokuapp.com/

I've been using Ruby as a scripting language for several months, but this is the first application I've ever built using Rails or AngularJS.  I'm aware that there are boundless improvements that can be made, but I wanted to dive in head-first and start learning.

My primary learning resources for getting up to speed were the excellent free book "Ruby on Rails Tutorial" by Michael Hartl.

I also appreciate the free AngularJS tutorial available at codecademy.com.

Last, but not least, I have enjoyed polishing up my Ruby knowledge by taking on coding challenges at codefights.com.

* Ruby version: 2.4.1p111

* Database creation: Run rake db:migrate

* How to run the test suite:  There is a class in the /lib folder caled tc_game.rb that I used to test out the initial PORO ruby implementation of the game.  The command line version of the game can be run with the /lib/main.rb runner file.
